# VR-School

VR School is an educational application created for providing immersive educational content for high school students in an interactive way. Different modules are created which covers various topics including physics, chemistry, biology and social studies. After the modules ends the application suggests related modules to the users for further viewing.

# Working

Once the user opens the application, they'll be viewing the intro page and once they get into the index page, they are given a chance to select the module which they wish to learn. 
After they select a module, the course starts. The user can interact with the high definiton 3D models in realtime and learn more about the concepts taught in the lecture. 
After the module is done, the user goes into a recommendation page where related chapters are suggested to the user.

## Working Video

# Technologies used
 * The environment was designed using 3D models downloaded from the internet and modified using Blender3D.
 * The animation of 3D models were scripted using C# in Unity3D.
 * The recommendation system was made using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
 * The application is deployed into Oculus Quest using SideQuest's App Lab.

# Trivia
Our University, Sastra Deemed to be University, Thanjavur, Tamilnadu has selected our project and our application will be deployed in 75 Oculus Quest 2 devices which will be distributed to 75 high schools all across Tamilnadu.

# Improvements / Further Work
* The recommendation system can be improved by adding more data into the dataset
* Further modules can be designed and developed and added into the application.
